# Privacy Policy - Altered Fast Trading

**Last updated:** December 2024

## Data Collection

This extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API:
- Your card list (the cards you want to transfer)
- A card reference dictionary (mapping image hashes to card IDs)
- Your selected friend preference

This data never leaves your browser except when making requests directly to altered.gg on your behalf.

## Authentication

The extension reads your existing altered.gg session from your browser to authenticate API requests. Your credentials are never stored or transmitted elsewhere.

## Third-Party Services

The extension communicates only with:
- `altered.gg` - To display buttons on your collection page
- `api.altered.gg` - To fetch your friends list and send card transfers

No analytics, tracking, or third-party services are used.
